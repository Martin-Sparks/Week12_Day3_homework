Polymorphism

(Q)What does the word 'polymorphism' mean?

(A)In object-oriented programming, polymorphism refers to a programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class. More specifically, it is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes.



(Q)What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.

(A) Polymorphism is allowing a block of code to act differently. So, a Java example would be to have a code block in a, interface and use that code in different child classes. 

(Q)What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?

(A)Passing code down from an interface or an abstract

(Q)How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?

(A) multiple 

(Q)Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.

To assign an open method to multiple classes 

Composition
(Q)What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?

(A)Composition is a concepts in object-oriented programming. It describes a class that references one or more objects of other classes in instance variables.


(Q)When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.

(A)To pass a perimeter or object down to a child component. 

(Q)What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition?

(A)Leaner code, fewer redundancies 

(Q)When an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?

(A)As they are part of the parent class, they can be reused.
